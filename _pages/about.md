About Me
======
I am a 3rd-year PhD student at the Chemical Engineering department at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). I am co-advised by Professors John Kitchin and Andrew Gellman. My research lies at the intersection between Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Machine Learning mainly for heterogenous catalysis. In my PhD work, I collaborate with experimental research groups in the Chemical Engineering and Material Science Departments at CMU. Part of my work is also in collaboration with the Facebook AI Research Chemistry ([FAIR-Chem](https://fair-chem.github.io/) team.
