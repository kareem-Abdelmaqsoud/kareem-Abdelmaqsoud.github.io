About Me
======
I am a 3rd-year PhD student at the Chemical Engineering department at Carnegie Mellon University. I am co-advised by Professors John Kitchin and Andrew Gellman. My research lies at the intersection between Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Machine Learning for heterogeneous catalysis and materials in general. In my PhD work, I collaborate with experimental research groups in the Chemical Engineering and Material Science Departments. I also collaborate with the Facebook AI Research Chemistry ([FAIR-Chem](https://fair-chem.github.io/)) team.
